# The Effects of pulse precipitation reduction on Pinus edulis and Juniperus monosperma plant water status and leaf gas exchange

To better understand the physiological responses to drought, many studies have used Piñon-Juniper woodlands as a model system to compare the primary stomatal regulation strategies represented by the relatively isohydric P. edulis and the anisohydric J. monosperma. The Chihuahuan Desert is especially useful for addressing physiological drought responses as it has monsoonal precipitation patterns that emphasize plants’ responses to pulses of precipitation.

Four physiological responses: maximum photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, water potential and midday leaf water content were analyzed to assess drought responses in Piñon and Juniper pre and post a monsoon event. The study uses previously established precipitation reduction treatments that include 0% (control), 45%, 70%, and 90% passive precipitation removals.
